# Getting Started

## Registration

When you sign up to Xavier you're asked to provide a team name. This is because we've designed Xavier from the ground up
to work well in a team environment - clients and shared reports can all be accessed by team members, so no wheels need
reinventing.

Think your company may already have a Xavier team? Drop your organiser a line and ask for an invite. In case they don't
know how to do this, you can share this help link with them:

## Adding Your First Client

It all kicks off in Xavier when you add your first client. A *Client* in Xavier is linked to an *Organisation* in Xero.

After you register you'll be taken to the home page. This is where your team's clients will live once they've been imported from Xero.

Clicking *Import your first client* will take you to Xero. You'll be asked to login if you haven't already:

And then you'll be asked to select and/or confirm the Xero organisation you want to connect to Xavier:

![Select Xero organisation](./images/select-xero-organisation.png)

After allowing Xavier access, you'll be redirected back to Xavier, where the initial sync process will begin.
This can take between 1 and 45 minutes depending on the size of the client.

Once the initial sync is finished, your client is ready for analysis - go forth!

## Client Overview
Clicking on a client card from the home page will take you through to the management of that specific client.

![Client Overview](./images/client-overview.png)

In addition to providing high level stats about a client, the overview is where you can manage a client, 
adjusting specific aspects from the *Edit* button, removing it from Xavier via the *Delete* button and un-linking it from
Xero using the *Unlink* button. 

Unlinking a client from Xero means it will remain in Xavier, but will no longer sync with Xero to retrieve the latest 
changes. A client can be re-linked to Xero at any point, and syncing will resume.  

[Syncing with Xero](/xero-integration.md#syncing) happens automatically overnight, but you can also trigger a sync on-demand 
via the *Sync Now* button. 

This view also highlights any issues with the client's Lock Dates - [find out more](/team-management.md#lock-dates).
