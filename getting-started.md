# Getting Started

## Registration

When you sign up to Xavier you're asked to provide a team name. This is because we've designed Xavier from the ground up 
to work well in a team environment - clients and shared reports can all be accessed by team members, so no wheels need
reinventing.

Think your company may already have a Xavier team? Drop your organiser a line and ask for an invite. In case they don't 
know how to do this, you can share this help link with them:

## Adding Your First Client

It all kicks off in Xavier when you add your first client. A *Client* in Xavier is linked to an *Organisation* in Xero.

After you register you'll be taken to the home page. This is where your team's clients will live once they've been imported from Xero.



Learn more about our interaction with Xero [here](/xero-integration.html).
