# FAQ

## Billing

### What is a client?
For Xavier, a client is a Xero organisation that Xavier will sync with – typically this is your business or your client’s
Xero account. Learn about our [Xero Integration](/xero-integration.md).

### What counts as a user?
Users are anybody that you invite into your Xavier [team](/team-management.md). All plans include unlimited users.

### Do I have to pay for each user?
No. The subscription price is inclusive of an unlimited number of users.

### How can I pay for Xavier?
We accept secure payments via MasterCard, Visa and AMEX. Credit card details can be entered within Xavier user settings,
either during or after your free trial.

### Is there a minimum term?
There are no minimum terms for your Xavier service. If you decide to cancel, you will have access to Xavier until the
end of your monthly billing cycle, which will not renew.

### When will I be billed?
Xavier bills in advance; you will receive an invoice for the number of clients present at the start of the monthly billing cycle, which begins when you have entered your payment details, and any free trials have ended.

### What happens when I add or remove clients?
If you add or remove a client during the monthly billing cycle, you will be billed accordingly for that client at the start of the next monthly billing cycle.  

### What's your Custom Pricing?
If you have more than 50 clients, please [get in touch](/contact-us.md) and we can arrange a custom plan for you that
will meet your needs.

### Can I change plans at any time?
If you're lucky enough to grow to need more than 50 clients whilst using Xavier, please inform us by
[email](/contact-us.md) and we'll get you sorted with a personalised plan right away.

## Working with Xero

### How do I connect Xavier to my Xero account?
A walkthrough of connecting Xavier to Xero can be found in our [Getting Started](/getting-started.md#adding-your-first-client) guide.

### What Xero data does Xavier use, and how?
With your approval, we create a *Client* in Xavier out of the data we get from Xero. We keep Xavier up to date with any
changes in Xero with an automated syncing process. Our [Xero Integration](/xero-integration.md#how-do-we-interact-with-xero)
guide has more info on the data we use, and the [syncing](/xero-integration.md#syncing) process.

### Can I stop Xavier from syncing with Xero?
Yes, you can [disconnect](/xero-integration.md#managing-the-xero-connection) Xavier from Xero, which retains a snapshot
of the data in Xavier without further updates. You can also [delete](/faq.md#how-can-i-remove-a-client-from-xavier) a
client from Xavier completely.

## Data Management

### Is my data secure?
Short answer: yes.

Longer answer: security is baked into the core of what we do, from the technologies we use to the best practices we
follow around coding and infrastructure. Each client's data is housed in its own separate database, key information
and backups are encrypted at rest and data in transit always journeys via SSL (https).

Your data is yours, and yours alone - we do not use or share your data with anyone.

### How can I remove a client from Xavier?
Deleting a client from Xavier removes all corresponding data from the Xavier system. This is not
reversable - to bring a client back you'll need to go through the process of
[adding a new client](/getting-started.md#adding-your-first-client).

There are two places you can delete a client from Xavier - the *Client Overview*:

![Delete From Overview](./images/delete-from-overview.png)

or from the options menu of a client on the *Client List* page:

![Delete From Client List](./images/delete-from-client-list.png)

You'll be prompted to confirm before proceeding.

Your data in Xero will not be affected by the removal of a client in Xavier.

::: tip
Just want to stop syncing with Xero? You can [disconnect](/xero-integration.md#managing-the-xero-connection) instead
:::

### How do I leave Xavier?
Had enough of Xavier and want to delete your account? At this point you'll need to [get in touch](/contact-us.md) with
us so we can remove you and your data from the system - we haven't built the ability to delete yourself from the system
automatically yet.
