# Insights
In addition to allowing you to slice and dice your Client data, Xavier applies a number of its own data analysis
techniques and presents the findings up as *Insights*...

## Unreconciled Transactions

Xavier lets you view a client's unreconciled bank transactions. It uses Xero's Bank Statement Report data to do so. 
From each record, you can click straight into Xero to start the reconciliation process. This insight allows you to
quickly order by the oldest records (useful if you are approaching month end), and also see/filter/group the records
that are in a "locked" period. 

You can also hit the *View All Items* button at the top of the insight to work with all bank statement records, not just
the unreconciled ones.

## Duplicate Contacts

The results shown in this Xavier insight are your Xero contacts that we’ve identified as potential duplicates. 
This can happen if you create a new contact during the process of inputting an invoice or similar, and miss the fact that
the contact already exists.

Review these, (soon you'll be able to dismiss any incorrect suggestions), and click on the Xero links for the contacts 
you want to amend.

## Multi-Coded Contacts

Each Invoice and Bank Transaction line item is assigned an Account Code and a Tax Code in Xero. 
The majority of the time, these codes *should* be consistent for a given supplier or customer. 

It happens to be best of us though - sometimes these records are assigned the wrong codes, or coding evolves over time.
We’ve crunched the numbers to find these potential mis-codings and you'll them presented in this insight, with helpful 
links directly to Xero allowing you to amend these where needed. 

Xero provides a dedicated mechanism for re-coding, and their support documentation on this is [here](https://central.xero.com/s/article/Find-Recode-a-group-of-transaction-lines).
