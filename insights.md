Each Invoice and Bank Transaction line item is assigned an Account Code and a Tax Code in Xero. 
The majority of the time, these codes *should* be consistent for a given supplier or customer. 

It happens to be best of us though - sometimes these records are assigned the wrong codes, or coding evolves over time.
Weâ€™ve crunched the numbers to find these potential mis-codings and you'll them presented in this insight, with helpful 
links directly to Xero allowing you to amend these where needed. 

Xero provides a dedicated mechanism for re-coding, and their support documentation on this is [here](https://central.xero.com/s/article/Find-Recode-a-group-of-transaction-lines).
