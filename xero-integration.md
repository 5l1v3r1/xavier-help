### Access Permissions 

When trying to add a client to Xavier, or re-connecting an existing client, 
you're redirected to Xero to give your approval. In some situations you may be presented with this:

![No Xero Organisation](./images/xero-no-organisation.png) 

There are a few reasons why you may be seeing this:

* **You don't have a Xero account**: Not to worry, you can [try Xero for free!](https://www.xero.com/signup/?xtid=x30xavier)

* **You are logged into Xero as a different user**: you may be logged in to Xero as a user you were not intending to use with Xavier. 
Try [heading over to Xero](https://go.xero.com/Dashboard/default.aspx/?xtid=x30xavier) and logging out before trying to add a client in 
Xavier again. This time you'll be asked to log into Xero, so you can log in as the user you intended.

* **You do not have the permissions in Xero**: each Xero user account has a 
[role assigned](https://central.xero.com/s/article/User-roles-and-permissions-in-Xero-Business-edition) 
to it for a Xero organisation.
You need to have either an *Advisor* or a *Standard* role to add a client in Xavier. This gives you access to an organisation's Xero settings,
including the ability to [set up or disconnect connected apps](https://central.xero.com/s/article/User-role-access-to-settings-in-Xero)
