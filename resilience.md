# Resilience
The Resilience section of Xavier is dedicated to ensuring that you have all the insights you need to understand where 
your clients strengths lie, or where they might have problems. 
This should give you the confidence to have have the right conversations with your clients. 

## Business Resilience

The first tool in our Resilience section, Business Performance is a series of KPIs carefully selected to give you a snapshot of how the business is performing in a 
given period. Each of the cards will give you a snapshot of the key figures, which can then be interrogated further by 
expanding the cards to see graphs and more granular data.
The purpose of this is to enable you to understand key risks for this business, identify them early so they can be 
rectified before it is too late.

### Revenue Movement

This check keeps track of revenue over time, and compares performance with the previous period. 
Expanding the card provides a graph of revenue over the life of the organisation, and a box where you can very quickly 
calculate and visualise the impact of growth on future revenue in the graph.

### Net Assets

Keep track of net assets over time, and compare current status with previous periods.

This check provides the total value of the organisation's net assets, and the % change period-on-period. Expanding the 
card provides a graph of net assets over the life of the organisation. 

### Customer Reliance

With this check, Xavier detects the top customer by percentage of total revenue during the period; a high percentage of revenue, and so a 
high reliance on a single customer is a considerable risk to the business.
Expanding the card shows the percentage of revenue by the top 5 customers in both a chart and a grid view displaying the 
revenue, number of transactions, and reliance, with links to Xero.   

For more insight into your clients' revenue sources, you can check out our [Sales Analysis](/insights.html#sales-analysis) insight. 

### Supplier Reliance

Like Customer Reliance above, Xavier detects the larges supplier by spend to the company by percentage of total costs during the period. 
Expanding the card displays this data in the form of a chart with the top 5 suppliers by cost, and a grid view displaying 
total cost, number of transactions, and the percentage of reliance on that supplier.
